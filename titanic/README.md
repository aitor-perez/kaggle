## Classification of Titanic survivors
Kaggle challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

#### 01-first-submission
Solution with a *Random Forest* approach based on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) notebook.

#### 02-preprocessing-and-cv
Solution using several models based on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions ) notebook, but adding cross-validation and parameter tuning.

#### 03-different-preprocessing
Similar approach to 02, but with a different preprocessing.
Here continuous variables are not discretized but normalized and categorical variables are one-hot encoded.  

#### 04-neural-networks
Different approach using neural networks with parameter tuning using grid search.

#### 05-neural-networks
Another neural network approach, using a genetic algorithm to tune the parameters.
